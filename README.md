<h3>Version:</h3>
<ul>0.1.0</ul>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Elmofire has been developed to keep up with the demand of Security Best Practices and Red Team exercises. During an assessment, typically Penetration Testers/Red Team Operators are tasked with bypassing current protections in place within corporate infrastuctures. As most Anti-Virus, likewise Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software solutions detect known malware samples based on heuristics and forensic fingerprinting, the goal of Elmofire is to bypass these detections. While not full-proof against every form of EDR on the planet ðŸŒŽ, Elmofire does an excellent job at generating a randomized and obfuscated payload in an attempt to evade these malware detection services. Currently bypassing all known Anti-Virus solutions on VirusTotal, (Feel free to generate a payload and see for yourself. ðŸ˜‰), the payloads generated by Elmofire are very likely to evade most protection software utilized by organizations throughout the Cyber Security industry.</p>
<h3>Dependencies:</h3>
<ul><code><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust - version 1.67.0</a></code></ul>
<ul><code><a href="https://github.com/cross-rs/cross">cross - version 0.2.5</a></code></ul>
<ul><code><a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker - version 20.10.12</a></code></ul>
<h4>NOTE:</h4>
<ul>On Linux, Docker runs in the context of the <code>root</code> user by default. To use <code>cross</code>, which uses Docker to compile Rust binaries, it is advised to add your current user to the <code>docker</code> group. E.g. <code>sudo usermod -aG docker user</code> After executing the above command, run <code>newgrp docker</code> in the context of your <code>user</code> or simply logout and log back in.</ul>

<h4>Developed and tested on:</h4>
<ul><code>Pop!_OS 22.04 (Ubuntu)</code></ul>
<ul><code>Kali Linux 2022.4 (Debian)</code></ul>

<h3>Installation:</h3>
<p>After following the instructions to install <code>rust</code>, <code>docker</code>, and <code>cross</code>, you can compile and build Elmofire using the <code>cargo build</code> command from inside the Elmofire source code folder.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/Elmofire/ef</code></p>
<p><code>cd ef/</code></p>
<p><code>cargo build</code></p>
<p>Once successfully compiled without errors, the <code>ef</code> binary file will be located within the <code>target/debug</code> path within the Elmofire source code directory. Feel free to relocate this binary to your most convienent file path configured in your <code>PATH</code> environment, or simply create an <code>alias</code> to point to the current location of the <code>ef</code> binary.</p>
